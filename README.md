# hello-world
My first GitHub repository - I intend to use this to evidence my journey as a developer and share creations
I am a student paramedic in the United Kingdom (and an EMT with 5 years of experience), taking the journey to beginning a secondary career in coding. I enjoy gaming, reading, hiking, and climbing (I'm a former Alpine climbing instructor!).
